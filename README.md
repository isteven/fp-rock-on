### About

Rock On is a QMK-powered, 69-keys ergonomic ortholinear unibody keyboard by [Fingerpunch](https://fingerpunch.xyz/). This build uses version 3.1 of the PCB. It supports both normal MX and Kailh low profile Choc switch, per-key-LEDs, trackball, Cirque trackpad, 3 rotary encoders, (8 bit?) audio, as well as haptic feedback. 

I prefer ergo ortho keyboards in unibody form over split keyboards, so I was really excited when I found this. For this build, I opt for the usual MX switch, trackball, audio and haptic feedback, but no rotary encoders as I don't really need them.

I re-designed a new case for it, based on the existing Rock On case. This design gives it a more modern, angular look. The top half is 3D printed using black resin, while the bottom half is printed using PLA.

I somehow found the the PCB & the logo appealing, so I created a small window at the bottom to display part of the PCB and the logo. It's printed using transparent resin.

Finally, one unique decorative element of the case is the illuminated Rock On logo on the trackball cover, as well as under the trackball holder. I use two SK6812 mini-e RGB LEDs, one under the logo, and another one under the trackball. These LEDs are soldered to the existing LED pads on the PCB using AWG 30 wires. It's a tedious work but worth the effort.
